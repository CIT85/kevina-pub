        <h2>Academic Goals</h2>
        <p>My academic goals consist of learning as much as I can with Web Development, become a Web Developer, create websites for others as a freelancer, and some for myself that I find enjoyable to be on. I want the certificates to back it all up to so that means getting a degree in computer science, all while gaining experience at the same time so I can build a good enough portfolio that people will want to go with me.</p>
        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
        Some personal Goals include wanting to create a new social platform and I aspire to help my family out as much as I am able to financially, I want to buy enough land for for us to live on, and I most definitely would like to start my own family one of these days, I want at least 3 kids haha. Another personal goal is to make passive income using youtube.
